# Weather-App Overview

## Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## API and Data Sample

api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip={zip code},{country code}&appid={API key}


## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.
 

#### MVP 
-allow user to input desired zip code
-retrieve current weather data from 3rd party api
-update weather image based on result


#### PostMVP  
- add a second form so users can compare two different zip codes
- have the background update based on current weather conditions
- build in logic for app to make attire recommendations

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
